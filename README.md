# sports-betting-best-price-execution

The arbitriag betting idea is simple, scraping best odds among all bookies on a particular sports event and working out the percentage of stake placed on all outcomes to guarantee profit (if possible).

The website I used to scrape data from started using websocket and the javascript involved was too hard to follow. I decided to use Splash to avoid looking at the painful code. Splash cannot be built on Rasbperry Pi easily so it will have to run on AWS for now.
